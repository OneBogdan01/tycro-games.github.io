### Title
*This needs to be interesting enough so that people click on the link to read the article.*
Some ideas:

- Grand Strategy Renderer 
- Creating a Procedural Terrain

### Introduction
*Explain what the audience can expect out of this article. Explain what you are going to explain.*

How to create in OpenGL a procedural mesh that can serve as a basis for more complex grand strategy map modes.

### Body
*This can be thought of as the story of the project. What are did you set out to create? What did you actually get done? What features does it have?*

- explain some of the quirks of grand strategy games
- 
- procedural terrain based on heightmap
  - go into briefly what are some of the solutions for this:
  - tesselation shaders
  - Geo mipmapping
  - Frustum Culling which can be further used with space partitioning
- texturing
  - go into some texturing techniques
- simple and cheap water
- map modes

### Conclusion
*Summarize what the article has been about, future ideas for the project. Problems that you encountered that were not discussed in the body.*

Basic starting point for creating a technologies that aid in creation of grand strategy games.

Future ideas:

- Tesselation shaders to generate the mesh
- Pipeline for generating procedural grand strategy worlds
- Rivers and lakes
- Foliage and cities
- Political map mode
