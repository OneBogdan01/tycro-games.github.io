## The problem
You work for some hours with [this](https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2020/Skeletal-Animation) notoriously buggy tutorial from LearnOpenGL and you encounter this magic bug: ![Alt text](IPOINT.png). You might need to use the callstack to find that line, or it might look like it is triggering from the line you ask assimp to parse the file: ![Alt text](image-1.webp)

## The fix
You open the .dae file to inspect it for the tag you encountered. I am going to spoil it for you and tell you that there are exactly three tags that are self closing: **comments**, **title** and **revision**.

# Why does it matter that they are self-enclosing?
Well, those three are the only self-enclosing in the whole file and you get an error from one of them. After you connect the dots and delete the tags everything should work properly.

## Conclusion
Yes, sometimes you make some horrible bugs in your code, but that's fine, because it is human. Even the biggest model parsing library has bugs!
