Hey! I am a game programmer with a big interest in game development, tech, and everything in between. If you would like to connect, whether to chat about projects, ideas, or anything game-dev related, you can reach me by:

- **LinkedIn**: [Bogdan Mocanu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-mocanu-8234581b1/)
- **Email**: [tycro.games@gmail.com](mailto:tycro.games@gmail.com)

Iâ€™m always up for talking with other developers and learning from different perspectives. Looking forward to hearing from you!
